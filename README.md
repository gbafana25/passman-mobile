# passman (mobile)

Mobile version of passman

## Summary

Encrypted password files are stored locally, and are updated with a remote private repository.  OAuth is used to access the private repo.  Websites can have multiple usernames associated with them.  Currently, the last used password stays in the clipboard in plaintext. 


## TODO
- add feature to add credentials from the mobile app
- make clipboard erase password after one use (like with xclip, if possible)
